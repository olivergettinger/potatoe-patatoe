<h2> What Is it <h2>
  <p> Fortnite aka Forknife is a Battle Royale Game made by Epic Games. You load in with 100 people and you try
    to be the last one standing you can build and you have a a wide vareity of weapons. There are different rarietys that increase value such as  <p>

      <li> Grey(lowest)</li>
      <li> Green</li>
      <li> Blue</li>
      <li> Purple</li>
      <li> Gold(highest)</li>

  <p> Fortnite comes out with different limited time game modes all the time. Personally my favorite is diamond rush oh sorry thats in minecraft. Playground
  is one of my favorites. You have an hour before the storm comes in. You can do many things in playground anything is aloud. There are 3 normal modes
in fortnite solo, duos, and squads. If you are up for a challenge try going in solo against squads.</p>
